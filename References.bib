abstract = {The dynamics and stability of thin liquid films have fascinated scientists over many decades: the observations of regular wave patterns in film flows down a windowpane or along guttering, the patterning of dewetting droplets, and the fingering of viscous flows down a slope are all examples that are familiar in daily life. Thin film flows occur over a wide range of length scales and are central to numerous areas of engineering, geophysics, and biophysics; these include nanofluidics and microfluidics, coating flows, intensive processing, lava flows, dynamics of continental ice sheets, tear-film rupture, and surfactant replacement therapy. These flows have attracted considerable attention in the literature, which have resulted in many significant developments in experimental, analytical, and numerical research in this area. These include advances in understanding dewetting, thermocapillary- and surfactant-driven films, falling films and films flowing over structured, compliant, and rapidly rotating substrates, and evaporating films as well as those manipulated via use of electric fields to produce nanoscale patterns. These developments are reviewed in this paper and open problems and exciting research avenues in this thriving area of fluid mechanics are also highlighted.},

abstract = {This paper describes a solid-state sensor for ultra-high-speed (UHS) imaging. The ‘Kirana' sensor was designed and manufactured in a 180 nm CMOS technology to achieve full-frame 0.7 Megapixel video capture at speeds at 2 MHz. The 30 $\mu$m pixels contain a pinned photodiode, a set of 180 low-leakage storage cells, a floating-diffusion, and a source follower output structure. Both the individual cells and the way they are arranged in the pixel are novel. The pixel architecture allows correlated double sampling for low noise operation. In the fast mode, the storage cells are operated as a circular buffer, where 180 consecutive frames are stored until receipt of a trigger; up to 5 video-bursts per second can be read out. In the ‘slow' mode, the storage cells act like a pipeline; the sensor can be read out like a conventional sensor at a continuous frame rate of 1,180 fps. The sensor architecture is fully scalable in resolution since memory cells are located inside each pixel. The pixel architecture is scalable in memory depth (number of frames) as a trade-off with pixel size, dependent on application. The present implementation of 0.7 Mpixels has an array focal plane which is optimized for standard 35 mm optics, whilst offering a competitive 180-frame recording depth. The sensor described has been manufactured and is currently being characterized. Operation of the sensor in the fast mode at 2 million frames per second has been achieved. Details on the camera/sensor operation are presented together with first experimental results. {\textcopyright} (2013) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

@article{Hendrix2016,
abstract = {When a millimetre-sized liquid drop approaches a deep liquid pool, both the interface of the drop and the pool deform before the drop touches the pool. The build-up of air pressure prior to coalescence is responsible for this deformation. Due to this deformation, air can be entrained at the bottom of the drop during the impact. We quantify the amount of entrained air numerically, using the boundary integral method for potential flow for the drop and the pool, coupled to viscous lubrication theory for the air film that has to be squeezed out during impact. We compare our results with various experimental data and find excellent agreement for the amount of air that is entrapped during impact onto a pool. Next, the impact of a rigid sphere onto a pool is numerically investigated and the air that is entrapped in this case also matches with available experimental data. In both cases of drop and sphere impact onto a pool the numerical air bubble volume {\$}V{\_}{\{}b{\}}{\$} is found to be in agreement with the theoretical scaling {\$}V{\_}{\{}b{\}}/V{\_}{\{}drop/sphere{\}}\backslashsim \backslashmathit{\{}St{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-4/3{\}}{\$} , where {\$}\backslashmathit{\{}St{\}}{\$} is the Stokes number. This is the same scaling as has been found for drop impact onto a solid surface in previous research. This implies a universal mechanism for air entrainment for these different impact scenarios, which has been suggested in recent experimental work, but is now further elucidated with numerical results.},

We observe experimentally the vortex street and the bubble-ring entrapments predicted numerically, for high impact velocities, by Thoraval et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 108, 2012, article 264506). These dynamics mainly occur within 50 $\mu$s after the first contact, requiring imaging at 1 million f.p.s. For a water drop impacting on a thin layer of water, the entrapment of isolated bubbles starts through azimuthal instability, which forms at low impact velocities, in the neck connecting the drop and pool. For Reynolds number Re above ∼12000, up to 10 partial bubble rings have been observed at the base of the ejecta, starting when the contact is ∼20{\%} of the drop size. More regular bubble rings are observed for a pool of ethanol or methanol. The video imaging shows rotation around some of these air cylinders, which can temporarily delay their breakup into micro-bubbles. The different refractive index in the pool liquid reveals the destabilization of the vortices and the formation of streamwise vortices and intricate vortex tangles. Fine-scale axisymmetry is thereby destroyed. We show also that the shape of the drop has a strong influence on these dynamics.},

Visualizations using fluorescent dye show the sheet originating from the underlying liquid layer, not the drop liquid. The sheet undergoes a characteristic instability, bending out of its plane and hitting the bottom layer. For some impact conditions the sheet folds in on itself.},

abstract = {When a drop impacts on a liquid surface it entraps a small amount of air under its centre as the two liquid surfaces meet. The contact occurs along a ring enclosing a thin disk of air. We use the next-generation ultra-high-speed video camera, capable of 1 million f.p.s. (Etoh et al. 2002), to study the dynamics of this air sheet as it contracts due to surface tension, to form a bubble or, more frequently, splits into two bubbles. During the contraction of the air disk an azimuthal undulation, resembling a pearl necklace, develops along its edge. The contraction speed of the sheet is accurately described by a balance between inertia and surface tension. The average initial thickness of the air sheet decreases with higher impact Reynolds numbers, becoming less than one micron. The total volume of air entrapped depends strongly on the bottom curvature of the drop at impact. A sheet of micro-bubbles is often observed along the original interface. Oguz-Prosperetti bubble rings are also observed. For low Weber numbers (We{\textless}20) a variety of other entrapment phenomena appear.},

abstract = {When a drop impacts onto a liquid pool, it ejects a thin horizontal sheet of liquid, which emerges from the neck region connecting the two liquid masses. The leading section of this ejecta bends down to meet the pool liquid. When the sheet touches the pool, at an “elbow,” it ruptures and sends off microdroplets by a slingshot mechanism, driven by surface tension. High-speed imaging of the splashing droplets suggests the liquid sheet is of submicron thickness, as thin as 300 nm. Experiments in partial vacuum show that air resistance plays the primary role in bending the sheet. We identify a parameter regime where this slingshot occurs and also present a simple model for the sheet evolution, capable of reproducing the overall shape.},

abstract = {We use ultra-high-speed video imaging to observe directly the earliest onset of prompt splashing when a drop impacts onto a smooth solid surface. We capture the start of the ejecta sheet travelling along the solid substrate and show how it breaks up immediately upon emergence from the underneath the drop. The resulting micro-droplets are much smaller and faster than previously reported and may have gone unobserved owing to their very small size and rapid ejection velocities, which approach 100 m s−1, for typical impact conditions of large rain drops. We propose a phenomenological mechanism which predicts the velocity and size distribution of the resulting microdroplets. We also observe azimuthal undulations which may help promote the earliest breakup of the ejecta. This instability occurs in the cusp in the free surface where the drop surface meets the radially ejected liquid sheet.},

abstract = {When a drop impacts at low velocity onto a pool surface, a hemispheric air layer cushions and can delay direct contact. Herein we use ultra-high-speed video to study the rupture of this layer, to explain the resulting variety of observed distribution of bubbles. The size and distribution of micro-bubbles is determined by the number and location of the primary punctures. Isolated holes lead to the formation of bubble necklaces when the edges of two growing holes meet, whereas bubble nets are produced by regular shedding of micro-bubbles from a sawtooth edge instability. For the most viscous liquids the air film contracts more rapidly than the capillary–viscous velocity through repeated spontaneous ruptures of the edge. From the speed of hole opening and the total volume of micro-bubbles we conclude that the air sheet ruptures when its thickness approaches {\~{}}100 nm.},

Various observations are brought together to give a unified picture of the overall transition between a compact macroscopic liquid volume and its subsequent dispersion into stable drops. In liquids, primary instabilities always give birth to more or less corrugated ligaments whose breakup determines the shape of the drop-size distribution in the resulting spray. Examples examined here include fragmentation of jets and liquid sheets, formation of spume by the wind blowing over a liquid surface, bursting phenomena upon an impact, and raindrops.},

@article{Weiss1999,
abstract = {Single drop impact onto liquid films is simulated numerically. Surface tension and gravity are taken into account, whereas viscosity and compressibility are neglected. This permits recourse to a boundary-integral method, based on an integral equation for a scalar velocity potential. Calculations are performed for normal impacts resulting in axisymmetric flows. For times that are small compared to the characteristic time of impact 2R/w0 (R being the drop radius, w0 its initial velocity towards the liquid film), it is found that a disk-like jet forms at the neck between the drop and the pre-existing liquid film, if the impact Weber number is high enough. This jet can pinch off a torus-shaped liquid volume at its tip or reconnect with the pre-existing liquid film, thus entraining a torus-shaped bubble. In reality, both the torus-shaped bubble and liquid torus will decay according to Rayleigh's capillary instability, thus breaking the cylindrical symmetry. This mechanism of bubble entrainment differs from those described in literature. For times that are comparable to or larger than the characteristic time of impact, capillary waves on the film, or the well-known crowns, are obtained again according to whether the impact Weber number is low or high enough.},

abstract = {The impact of a drop onto a liquid layer produces a splash that results from the ejection and dissolution of one or more liquid sheets, which expand radially from the point of impact. In the crown splash parameter regime, secondary droplets appear at fairly regularly spaced intervals along the rim of the sheet. By performing many experiments for the same parameter values, we measure the spectrum of small-amplitude perturbations growing on the rim. We show that for a range of parameters in the crown splash regime, the generation of secondary droplets results from a Rayleigh–Plateau instability of the rim, whose shape is almost cylindrical. In our theoretical calculation, we include the time dependence of the base state. The remaining irregularity of the pattern is explained by the finite width of the Rayleigh-Plateau dispersion relation. Alternative mechanisms, such as the Rayleigh–Taylor instability, can be excluded for the experimental parameters of our study.},

abstract = {We used optical and X-ray imaging to observe the formation of jets from the impact of a single drop with a deep layer of the same liquid. For high Reynolds number there are two distinct jets: the thin, fast and early-emerging ejecta; and the slow, thick and late-emerging lamella. For low Reynolds number the two jets merge into a single continuous jet, the structure of which is determined by the distinct contributions of the lamella and the ejecta. We measured the emergence time, position and speed of the ejecta sheet, and find that these scale as power laws with the impact speed and the viscosity. We identified the origin of secondary droplets with the breakup of the lamella and the ejecta jets, and show that the size of the droplets is not a good indicator of their origin.},
