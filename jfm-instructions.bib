% The journal titles should not contain any special character when using jabbrv (journal title abbreviation):
% Characters not allowed when using jabbrv, but allowed without jabbrv: '~' '\ ' '\_' and diacritics followed by a space such as '\^ '
% See http://www.grappa.univ-lille3.fr/FAQ-LaTeX/29.57.html or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic
% Characters not allowed, even without the jabbrv: '^' '_' '&'. They are allowed without jabbrv only with '\' before.
% Possible reason to use these characters:
%%% "LaTeX has its own rules for deciding the lengths of blank spaces. For instance, LaTeX will put an extra amount of space after a full stop if it considers that the full stop marks the end of a sentence."
%%% "The rule adopted by LaTeX is to regard a period (full stop) as the end of a sentence if it is preceded by a lowercase letter. If the period is preceded by an uppercase letter then LaTeX assumes that it is not a full stop but follows the initials of somebody's name."
%%% "This works very well in most cases. However LaTeX occasionally gets things wrong. This happens with a number of common abbreviations (as in `Mr.\ Smith' or in `etc.'), and, in particular, in the names of journals given in abbreviated form (e.g., `Proc.\ Amer.\ Math.\ Soc.'). The way to overcome this problem is to put a backslash before the blank space in question."

@article{Thoraval2012,
abstract = {The splashing of a drop impacting onto a liquid pool produces a range of different sized microdroplets. At high impact velocities, the most significant source of these droplets is a thin liquid jet emerging at the start of the impact from the neck that connects the drop to the pool. We use ultrahigh-speed video imaging in combination with high-resolution numerical simulations to show how this ejecta gives way to irregular splashing. At higher Reynolds numbers, its base becomes unstable, shedding vortex rings into the liquid from the free surface in an axisymmetric von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortex street, thus breaking the ejecta sheet as it forms.},
